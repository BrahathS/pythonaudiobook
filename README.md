# Python Audiobook

Created a audiobook file in python to live text-to-speech that runs this Python audiobook script.

It will read your pdf documents from your folder and it is also able to save as mp3.


To begin with the context, add this file along with PDF file and replace the DLML.pdf on the python file to file that document is saved on your disk. 

After that you need to check "startoffpage" as it is important to check you PDF file the number of pages

However you have a textbook you need to jump to chapters, if this change is not done then there will be confilct understanding the files   

To get to certain page check the total pages : print("page"). The book start from 0 count and getting to certain page means if page 17 is your start then change it 16 (n-1).

Finally, You can run the code as it will read out :)

Option to save can be considered by uncomment the line
